# Weknow Cypher Builder
This library is still in **alpha stage**.  
This means that the API still constantly changing.  
Our goals to reach Beta (more stable API) in the next few months.

## Usage
Build cypher query in a reusable & structured way.

## Goals
Cypher Builder aim to be developer friendly library for cypher query.
It bring as match intellisense & cypher correction as it can
while keeping the Cypher expression readable.

## Better Together
This library don't aim to execute the Cypher, it design to work with other libraries like Neo4JMapper & others.
