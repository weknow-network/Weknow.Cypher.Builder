# Weknow Cypher Builder
This library is still in alpha stage.

# Usage
Build cypher query in a reusable & structured way.

# Goals
Cypher Builder aim to be developer friendly library for cypher query.
It bring as match intellisense & cypher correction as it can
while keeping the Cypher expression readable.

This library don't aim to be a Cypher executer, instead it design to work with other
libraries like [Neo4JMapper](https://github.com/barnardos-au/Neo4jMapper) & others.
